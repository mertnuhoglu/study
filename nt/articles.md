	1,500 people give all the relationship advice you’ll ever need
		https://markmanson.net/relationship-advice
		To me, perhaps the most interesting nugget from Gottman’s research is the fact that most successful couples don’t actually resolve all of their problems. In fact, his findings were completely backwards from what most people actually expect: people in lasting and happy relationships have problems that never completely go away, while couples that feel as though they need to agree and compromise on everything end up feeling miserable and falling apart
		Never insult or name-call your partner. Put another way: hate the sin, love the sinner. Gottman’s research found that “contempt”—belittling and demeaning your partner—is the number one predictor of divorce
		Criticizing your partner’s character (“You’re so stupid” vs “That thing you did was stupid”)
		Defensiveness (or basically, blame shifting, “I wouldn’t have done that if you weren’t late all the time”)
		Contempt (putting down your partner and making them feel inferior)
		Stonewalling (withdrawing from an argument and ignoring your partner)
		Successful couples, like unsuccessful couples, he found, fight consistently. And some of them fight furiously
		What Gottman does is he gets married couples in a room, puts some cameras on them, and then he asks them to have a fight.
		Talking bad about them will erode your respect for them and make you feel worse about being with them, not better
		The one word that I keep coming back to is “respect.” Of course, this means showing respect, but that is too superficial. Just showing it isn’t enough. You have to feel it deep within you. I deeply and genuinely respect him for his work ethic, his patience, his creativity, his intelligence, and his core values.

    ampul hikayesi  
      https://youtu.be/5B5C-4FBz0c?t=50m40s
      haftalarca bir ampul özelliği geliştirdik video player için. ie6'da çalışmıyor, 7'de çalışıyor. dur ağbi, bitecek.
      sonunda hakikaten değdi. bir ay içinde 6 kez kullanılmış.
      acele acele demek istemiyorum da, çabuk çabuk. 
      mümkün olduğunca hızlı, bırakın, serbest bırakın. sonradan yaparsınız. aceleniz yok.

      too many genarals, not enough infantry
      herkes patron, cepheye gidecek asker yok.
      şunun şurasına şöyle bir şey yapalım. burasına da böyle bir şey yapalım. tabi yapalım. yani yapılsın. keşke olsa. kim yapacak. yaparız. onu ben şeye yaptırırım.
      herkes yapalım. aklımıza süper bir fikir geliyor.

### Towards Design Theory and expandable rationality - Herbert Simon by Armand Hatchuel id=g10185

  Towards Design Theory and expandable rationality - Herbert Simon by Armand Hatchuel <url:file:///~/Dropbox/mynotes/content/articles/articles.md#r=g10185>
  Armand Hatchuel
  intro
    Simon's self description
      i am a monomaniac in decision making
    explain complex behaviour by simple, constrained, informed decision rules
    emprically grounded theory of human problem solving
    foundation stone of behavioural economics
    problem solving
      key for
        science of design
          = science of artificial
            opposed to: natural sciecnes
    design theory unfinished
      2 reasons
        design: special form of problem solving
          correct:
            problem solving is restricted form of design
        social interaction: limited in design process
      expandable rationality
        potential paradigm for design theory
  from decision making to design theory
    50s: rational behaviour = optimization
      deterministic (simple)
      expected utility (sophisticated)
      OR, micro economics, statistics
    bounded rationality and decision paradigm
      bounded rationality
        refuses optimal choice
      satisficing principle
        introduces subjectivity, rules of thumb, heuristics, ad hoc moves
        satisfaction
          endogeneously defined within decision process
        how to research decision making
          games, puzzles: how we look for satisficing solutions
    creativity and design as problem solving
      distinction between sciences:
        natural sciences
          study how the world is 
          excludes normative
        sciences of the artificial = design sciences
          study how thing should be in order to attain goals
      his approach to design process
        "The processes of creative thinking"
          the product of thinking has novelty and value
          the problem was vague and ill defined
          part of the task was to formulate the problem itself
          imagery:
            a plan to problem solver
            as a list of elements he his dealing
          imagination
            necessary for creative process
            role: offer a list of options
              to progressively explore
              until satisficing solution appears
  an approach to design theory: limits of a problem solving perspective
    complexity comes from
      combinatorial explosion of solutions
    satisficing solutions
      dependent on previous experience
    what are differences between problem solving and design theory
      going to the pictures or a nice party
        ex: go to movie or party?
          bounded rationality conditions
            impossible to see all movies and choose the best
            meaning of good is vague
            satisficing criteria necessary
          movie evaluation
            computation costs - interact - explored solutions
              read critics
              phone friends
              expertise about actors
          party evaluation
            party is infinitely expandable concept
              unexpected expansions of initial concepts
                case 1 - movie selection
                  during discussions: question remains unchanged
                case 2
                  unexpected designs of what is a party can emerge from the process
                what makes it possible?
                  distinguishes design from problem solving
                    organize a nice party 
                      simon
                        it is: vague ill-structured problem
                          bc: what is "nice" party?
                        define problem space to form it
                      design theory
                        it is: clear and well formulated departure point
                        apparently vague:
                          allows 
                            for conformity to usual
                            or for innovation
                          constraints
                            will be investigated
                  why some design problems are not real design projects
                    a real design project
                      if initial concepts allows for unexpected expansions
                  design projects: not always creative
                    simon: imagination to provide first list of actions
                      then problem solving heuristics
                    difficulties in this
                      imagination 
                        is not exogeneous to design process
                        can not be triggered by designable procedures
                      imagination
                        can appear everywhere in proces
              design of learning devices
              social interaction as a design resource
          unexpected expansions of initial concepts

#### Managing the bots that are managing the business

  http://sloanreview.mit.edu/article/managing-the-bots-that-are-managing-the-business

Managers must become product and experience designers, deeply engaged with customers and their needs, creating services that start out as a compelling promise and get better over time the more people use them, via a “build-measure-learn” process

Workers can be “upskilled” not just by training but by software assistants that allow them to do jobs for which they were previously under-qualified.
