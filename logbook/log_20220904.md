Design is separating into things that can be composed. -- Rich Hickey
Clojure separates data from functionality
	By treating data as first-class citizens
	Pure functions working on data
	Clj is opposite of OOP
The idea is to separate data from functionality as opposed to OOP. Why?
When you combine two pieces of data you get data. When you combine two machines you get trouble. -- RH
4 core data structers
	(1 2 3) ; list
	["a" "b"] ; vector
	{:a 12 :b 21} ; map
	#{1 2 3} ; set
Data as syntax:
	Visualises data
Makes it easier 
	to think about it
	to construct nested data
		this is main data kind of the systems
	[{:a 12 :b ["a" "c"]}]
	verinin şeklini görmek çok zordur program formatındayken
Clojure code is data (homoiconicity)
Prefix notation
	simplifies syntax
	çünkü her durumda kodun şekli aynıdır, operatörlerden veya assignment işlemlerinde özel durum gerekmez
	nested list ile daha büyük yapılar inşa edebilirsin
		(if (< 1 2) "a" "b")
Nobody wants to program with mutable strings anymore, why do you want to program with mutable collections? -- RH
Diğer dillerde de artık immutable collectionlar var
	ama clj'de bu dilin tasarımını etkilemiş
Eventually, with mutable objects you create an intractable mess. And encapsulation does not get rid of that. Encapsulation only means: "well I'm in charge of this mess" -- RH
Clojure is data-oriented
	separates data from functionality
	visualises data
	code is data
	collections are immutable
Defining new functions
	You define functions in the same way as values
	(def greetings (fn [name] (str "Hello " name)))
Systems are dynamic and data driven. It might be a nice idea to use a language that is also dynamic and data driven. -- RH


# [How Climate and Geography Shaped Scandinavian Prosperity and Democracy](https://erikexamines.substack.com/p/how-climate-and-geography-shaped) id=g13273

Water management was a key reason for this immense power. These rulers basically held a gun to the head of every farmer. Should the farmers not play ball, they would not get their needed share of water from the centralized irrigation, canal and dam system that had been built up.

Whenever China collapsed into multiple states, food production dropped like a stone. The reason was simple: Maintaining all the complex network of canals required vast amounts of coordination and manpower over a large area. Such work could only be done by a large powerful state.

A polder is the opposite. Everybody must maintain the dike they live next to or everybody dies from flooding. It is a bit like the cold war concept of mutually assured destruction (MAD).

Thus the German aristocracy could control trade in a way Danish aristocrats and local rulers could not. Thus a more free and independent peasantry evolved in Denmark. They could more easily trade with each other without some kind of centralized power manipulating or controlling this trade.
