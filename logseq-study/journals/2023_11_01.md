- #vim #mynt Neovim exits/crashes suddenly when editing a file
	id:: 972847ac-2c4d-4ce7-8f77-0e2a4a43d2ec
	- I couldn't find the cause of the problem. 
	- I disabled all the plugins. 
	- I upgraded neovim to nightly and current production versions.
	- I upgraded kitty.
	- I tried other terminals such as Terminal.app.
	- I tried to delete everything except the line that causes exiting.
	- Only solution so far:
		- Set file type of markdown document to txt. Then neovim doesn't crash.
