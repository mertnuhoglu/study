- Income = output.
	- Bu elde ettikleri gelire aynı zamanda output diyoruz.
	- Bu gelir ikiye bölünür:
		- Bir kısmı tasarruf (Savings) olarak M2'de biriktirilir.
		- Diğer kısmı tüketim (Consumption) olarak yeniden M1'e akar.
- M2
	- Inflow: Savings
	- Outflow: Investment
	- Tasarruf hesaplarında biriken para. Bankalardaki para gibi düşünebiliriz.
	- M2 -> Interest-Rate (-)
	- Interest-Rate -> Investment-Rate (-)
	- Interest-Rate -> Saving-Rate (+)
- #qst M1, yatırım akışını nasıl etkileyebiliyor? Yatırımlar M2'den çıkıyor. O zaman M2'den etkileniyor olması gerekmez mi? (sf 16)

- Klasik ekonomik modellerde zaman yoktur. Arz ve talep her zaman ve anda dengededir. Denge bozulduğunda tekrar dengeye dönmesi zaman gerektirmez. Bu sorunu ele almaz. Stok ve akış ayrımı yapmayışından dolayı bu böyle. Her şey birer akış değişkeni.

> Secondly, we cannot trace the causal structure in the system without a time component. Equilibrium is a static condition by definition. When everything happens at the same time, we cannot know which caused which.

> As Kaldor [18] explains, orthodox economic theory focuses on “the allocation of scarce resources among alternative uses” and implicitly assumes that this allocation is handled by the system itself. There is not much we can do about it except making the markets more efficient by leaving it alone.

> The important rule of this market game is that no deal is made until market equilibrium is attained and buyers and sellers can make contracts of transactions. In this sense, time for adjustment is not a real time in which economic activities such as production and transactions take place, but the one needed for calculation.

> Logical time is an abstraction for modelers and model readers. Modelers need to solve the optimization problem of ‘idealized’ economic agents and solve the game-theoretic problem between different types of agents on the different sides of transactions.

> In that sense, logical time may be considered as a heuristic tool for the optimization procedure regarding the economic agents which are assumed to be ‘perfectly rational'.

> In equilibrium analysis, we try to find the equilibrium solutions based on the ‘optimal decisions’ of the agents. We assume that those decisions are ‘instantaneous actions’ of them. Decisions (actions) of the agents generate a constraint for the other side of the transaction. We then derive the feasible decisions of the agents by defining their decisions as constraints to the others. The solution set is then called ‘equilibrium’.

> For example, when we use equilibrium analysis, we assume that firms decide how much to produce a certain product given a price and they hire enough labor (and raw material) for this production. Workers hired by firms bargain for a wage which is consistent both to the labor/leisure decision of the workers and the costs affordable by firms considering the price of the products. These workers receive their wages and decide to spend a portion of it for consumption. Each worker maximizes his utility function by choosing from different products based on their prices. Workers then go and buy from the products exactly the same amount the firms decided to produce in the first place. These all happen, as we assume, at the same time.

> There is a logical inconsistency in this story if we look at it in historical time. Even if everything happened instantaneously, there is a circular reasoning. The consumption decision ‘resulted’ from an income ‘cannot be a part of’ the transaction which will ‘lead to’ that income (unless they are all determined at the same time in accordance but that is impossible in an environment with too many decision makers).

> To sum up, static equilibrium method uses game-theoretic approach to find the pareto-optimal solutions for optimizing agents. Circular reasoning in this method is a purposeful abstraction which is useful in this kind of framework. 

> In that sense, firms do not compare the costs and revenues of a certain production ‘event’, rather they compare the costs incurred during the production process and the revenues expected to be generated upon them at a later date. The key point is that, decisions and their consequences do not happen at the same momentary time.
