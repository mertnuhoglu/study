7. The gain around driving positive feedback loops.
6. The structure of information flows (who does and does not have access to information).

4. The power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure.
3. The goals of the system.
2. The mindset or paradigm out of which the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises.
1. The power to transcend paradigms.
