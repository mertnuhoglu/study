; & body: This is a crucial part. The & symbol is used to indicate a "rest" argument or a "variadic" argument. In this context, it means that body represents zero or more expressions that form the body of the let block. These expressions are evaluated sequentially, and the value of the last expression is returned as the result of the let form.

; (let ...): This indicates that we're dealing with the let special form, which is used for creating lexical bindings (local variables) within a specific scope.
